      <p class="fs-5 text-left">
        I’m James, the founder of Khumalo Craft, and I’m thrilled to share our story with you. At Khumalo Craft, we celebrate the artistry of handcrafted creations, bringing together traditional techniques and contemporary design in a collection that’s truly unique.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5 text-left">
        My journey began with a deep appreciation for the beauty and skill involved in artisanal craftsmanship. Growing up, I was surrounded by the vibrant culture of traditional crafts,
        and I’ve always admired the meticulous care and creativity that artisans pour into their work.
        This admiration turned into a passion, and eventually, Khumalo Craft was born out of a desire to honor these age-old traditions while integrating modern design sensibilities.
      </p>

      <p class="fs-5 text-left">Every piece in our collection is a labor of love, meticulously crafted by skilled artisans who share my dedication to quality and innovation.
        I’m personally involved in selecting each item, ensuring that it embodies the perfect blend of traditional artistry and contemporary flair.
        Our goal is to offer you not just beautiful pieces, but ones that tell a story and connect you to a rich heritage.

      <p class="fs-5 text-left">Thank you for visiting Khumalo Craft and for being a part of this journey. I invite you to explore our collection and discover the beauty and craftsmanship that make our creations truly exceptional.</p>
